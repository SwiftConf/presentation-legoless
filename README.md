# Debugging Takes Time - Can we speed it up?

This repository contains resources for [my talk](http://objcgn.com/speaker/dal/) at [SwiftConf 2015](http://objcgn.com).

The talk introduces [Alpha](https://github.com/legoless/Alpha) - a debugging framework.

The talk is also available on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/legoless/debugging-takes-time-can-we-speed-it-up).

# Notes

The generated .PDF has some missing characters due to [bug](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5987861?start=15&tstart=0) in Keynote, so this repository also contains image version.
